Not all those who wander are lost.
Youâ€™re the kind of person I wanna be with when I want to be alone.
It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.
Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.
And in that moment I swear we were infinite.People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.
When you find out you can live without it, go along not thinking about it.
There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a single flashing, throbbing moment.
Happiness can be found even in the darkest times if one only remembers to turn on the light.
That's when I finally got it. I finally understood. It wasn't the thought that counted. It was the actual execution that mattered, the showing up for somebody. The intent behind it wasn't enough. Not for me. Not anymore. It wasn't enough to know that deep down, he loved me. You had to actually say it to somebody, show them you cared. 
I think you're the sort of person who finds money on the ground and waves it in the air and asks if anyone has lost it. I think you cry in movies that aren't even sad because you have a soft heart, though you don't let it show. I think you do things that scare you, and that makes you braver than those adrenaline junkies who bungee-jump off bridges.
You know, when it works, love is pretty amazing. It's not overrated. There's a reason for all those songs.
